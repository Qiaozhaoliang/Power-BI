•	If you have configured the app workspace so that members have edit permissions, the RLS roles will not be applied to them. Users will be able to see all of the data.
  So, if we want to make the row-level security(RLS) work, we need configure the workspace members can only view Power BI content:

 
•	If you change the roles or rules in Power BI Desktop and publish the Power BI file to Power BI Service, you need add the members of the security groups again(because the old roles and groups have been away).


•	The Distribution Group and Security Group (ID Web, Office 365 Account) could be used in row-level security, but couldn’t be two or more level. (For this case, no document describes it, we find it during the test). 
  For example:

  Group A has members: A1(user), A2(user),A3(group),A4(user), A1,A2,A4 are users, but A3 is a group. A3 has members B1,B2.

  If when we share the dashboard or report, when add the Group A, and add Group A into the row-level security group,

  A1,A2,A4 could visit the data, but B1,B2 could not visit the data.
